# 🚕 Zuber Ride-Sharing Data Analysis

Zuber is a new ride-sharing company preparing to launch in Chicago. As part of their analytical team, this project aims to uncover insights about passenger preferences and assess the impact of external factors—like weather—on ride frequency. By understanding these patterns, Zuber can better tailor its services and competitive strategy.

## 📌 Project Objective

> **Goal**: Analyze ride-sharing data from competitors, identify patterns in customer behavior, and test the hypothesis that weather conditions affect ride demand in Chicago.

## 🗂️ Data Description

- Database tables covering:
  - Ride records from competitors
  - Weather data (temperature, precipitation, etc.)
  - Temporal data (dates, times)
- Data stored in a relational format queried with SQL.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

- **Data Collection**:
  - Connected to a relational database using SQL.
  - Retrieved relevant tables and columns.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Inspected for missing or inconsistent values.
  - Filtered for relevant timeframes and locations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Used SQL queries to aggregate and group data.
  - Analyzed ride counts over time and in different weather conditions.
  - Compared competitor data to infer market patterns.
- **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Formulated hypothesis on weather’s effect on ride demand.
  - Used aggregated data to assess correlations between weather factors and ride frequency.
