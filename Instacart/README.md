# 🛒 Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis

This project explores customer shopping habits using real-world Instacart order data. Instacart is an online grocery delivery platform similar to Uber Eats or DoorDash, where users place orders for home delivery. The dataset (originally from a 2017 Kaggle competition) was modified to include missing and duplicate values while preserving its original distribution—making it an ideal case study for data cleaning and exploratory analysis.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

- Publicly released Instacart dataset, modified to:
  - Reduce size for faster computation.
  - Introduce missing and duplicate values (for cleaning practice).
  - Preserve overall distribution of order patterns.
- Contains:
  - Order details
  - Product and aisle information
  - User purchasing history

## ⚙️ Methodology

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Identified and removed duplicate entries.
  - Handled missing values to ensure dataset integrity.
  - Verified data types and corrected inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Aggregated orders by user, product, and aisle.
  - Calculated order frequencies, popular products, and aisles.
  - Explored reordering trends and user loyalty.
- **Visualization**:
  - Created informative plots with clear titles, labels, legends.
  - Used matplotlib to highlight trends in purchasing behavior.
  - Communicated results with clean, well-labeled figures.
