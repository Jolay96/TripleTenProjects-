# üõ¢Ô∏è OilyGiant: Oil Well Location Selection and Profit Analysis

As a data scientist at **OilyGiant Mining Company**, your mission is to help identify the best location for drilling a new oil well. By analyzing oil well parameters across three regions, you‚Äôll build a predictive model to estimate reserves, rank potential wells, and determine which region offers the highest total profit while accounting for uncertainty and risk.

## üìå Project Objective

> **Goal**: Build a model that predicts oil reserves in new wells and select the region with the highest potential profit.  
> Use statistical analysis to evaluate and compare regions, accounting for profit variability and investment risk.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

- Data on oil samples from three regions.
- For each well:
  - Parameters describing oil quality.
  - Known volume of reserves (target variable).
- Each region contains many wells for model training and evaluation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

- **Data Exploration**:
  - Inspected and visualized oil well parameters.
  - Compared data distributions across regions.
- **Model Building**:
  - Built regression models (Linear Regression) to predict reserve volume.
  - Trained and validated on regional datasets.
- **Well Selection**:
  - Predicted reserve volumes in each region.
  - Selected top oil wells with highest estimated reserves.
- **Profit Calculation**:
  - Modeled revenue and costs.
  - Calculated potential profit for each region based on selected wells.
- **Risk Analysis**:
  - Used the **Bootstrapping** technique to simulate profit distributions.
  - Estimated average profit, confidence intervals, and risk of losses.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Chose the region with the highest expected profit and acceptable risk profile.
