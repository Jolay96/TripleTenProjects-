# üé¨ The Film Junky Union: Movie Review Sentiment Classification

The **Film Junky Union** is a new, edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts that aims to improve discussions by filtering out negative reviews. This project develops a natural language processing (NLP) model that can automatically detect negative reviews in movie commentary. Using a labeled IMDB reviews dataset, the model classifies text as **positive** or **negative**, with the goal of reaching an **F1 score of at least 0.85**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

- IMDB movie reviews dataset with polarity labels:
  - Review text
  - Label: **positive** or **negative**
- Used for supervised binary classification.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
  - Removed duplicates and irrelevant characters.
  - Standardized text (lowercasing, removing punctuation).
- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization
  - Lemmatization or stemming
  - Stop word removal
  - Vectorization using TF-IDF
- **Model Training**:
  - Split data into training and test sets.
  - Trained classification algorithms including:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Naive Bayes
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Tuned hyperparameters for best performance.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Measured model performance using:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1-score (target ‚â• 0.85)
  - Selected best-performing model for deployment.
- **Validation**:
  - Tested model on unseen data to verify generalization.
