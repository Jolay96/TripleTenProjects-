# üéÆ Ice Video Game Sales Forecasting

You work for **Ice**, an online store that sells video games globally. To better plan marketing campaigns, the company needs to understand which games are likely to succeed. By analyzing user reviews, expert ratings, genre, platform, ESRB ratings, and historical sales data, this project identifies patterns that help predict game sales.  

This analysis is set in **December 2016** and aims to forecast sales for 2017, simulating real-world planning based on available historical data.
